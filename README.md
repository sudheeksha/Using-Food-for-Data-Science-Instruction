This is repository consist of all the code and report on my work for Capstone Project done at Rochester Institute of Technology.

Using difficult topics when teaching machine learning can induce anxiety in students and cause them to mentally distant from the subject matter resulting in a lack of teaching effectiveness.
Topics such as cancer, pandemics, mortality can distract the listener from the key points. Using familiar examples such as food, the students can learn the methodology without becoming distracted because it is more relatable.  This paper demonstrates methods of teaching machine learning using examples drawn from food and cooking.
