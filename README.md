# Using Food for Data Science Instruction
This is repository consist of all the code and report on my work for Capstone Project done at Rochester Institute of Technology.

# Abstract

Using difficult topics when teaching machine learning can induce anxiety in students and cause them to mentally distant from the subject matter resulting in a lack of teaching effectiveness.
Topics such as cancer, pandemics, mortality can distract the listener from the key points. Using familiar examples such as food, the students can learn the methodology without becoming distracted because it is more relatable.  This paper demonstrates methods of teaching machine learning using examples drawn from food and cooking.

# Background 

Traditionally, machine learning has been used for cancer diagnoses, climate change, classifying a virus, and other grim topics. For example, here is a paper~\cite{IEEEexample:brecan} on a Comparison of Machine Learning algorithms on breast cancer diagnosis. They have applied popular machine learning techniques to classify Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset~\cite{uci}, and the classification performance of methods was compared with each other using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC Area. The Support Vector Machines obtained the best performance with the highest accuracy. 

An example of climate change in Machine learning is this paper~\cite{IEEEexample:5406743}. The authors of this paper derive a hierarchical cohort of high-risk senior citizens, outpatients, clusters, and proactively deliver population health insights and timely health services through alerting governmental and non-governmental agencies. This system is developed using Apriori, Naive Bayesian, and artificial intelligence algorithms. 

In this paper~\cite{IEEEexample:5510726}, the authors used artificial neural networks for the prediction of important influenza virus antigenic types and the hosts, to create a computational system for influenza surveillance. They found that the accuracy of classification can vary based on the host and gene segment. Compared to virus such avian and swine flu, human viruses can be classified with a higher accuracy. This indicates that human viruses have adapted to their human hosts. All of these results show that Data Science can save lives. While these topics are incredibly important, it can be difficult for a student in a learning environment. 

Due to the current pandemic, there is a lot to be learned from the spread of viruses such as modeling viral spreading, exponential growth, and geometric decay. However, obviously, many people find it disturbing to talk about the virus because of the mortality rate associated with it. Instead of talking about a virus such as COVID-19, we can talk about food trends or fads. Fads can behave like a virus. They have a quick rise and steep decline in a short amount of time. Here are two or three food fads that demonstrate this. The following examples are based on the presumption that when someone searches on a topic that they are interested in it.

An example of food fad is Dalgona coffee induced by the isolation during COVID-19. As per Youtube searches on Google Trends~\cite{google}, \emph{“How to make Dalgona coffee”} has become the most searched type of coffee recipe worldwide. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:dalgona}, searches worldwide for Dalgona coffee recipe peaked in mid-April and declined by the end of April.
